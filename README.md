Course Materials Used for MA6630 in City University of Hong Kong.

This course covers the basic principles, methodologies, and algorithms for the statistical and machine learning.
I am no expert in this area. But as an applied and computmational mathematician, I enjoyed the (painful) process of preparing  these materials: IMHO, the statistical and machine learning is quite like the applied math:  modelling based on physics or domain knowledge with reasonale assumptions of mechanism -> develop computational techniques tools to solve by computers (so, numerical linear algebra and optimzation )  ->  assess the accuracy of models.  The last part is perhaps largely ignored in the applied math area because it is more related to specific domain knowledge; while this part is the core part of statistician: to evaluate the uncertainty of the model output and to improve the model. 

Overall, the coverage here is very classic, but my viewpoint might not be as traditional as you assume.
Senior undergraduates should be able to follow.
