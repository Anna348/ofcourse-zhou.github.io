Course Materials Used for MA6630 in City University of Hong Kong.

This course covers the basic principles, methodologies, and algorithms for the statistical and machine learning.
I am no expert in this area. But as an applied and computmational mathematician, I enjoyed the (painful) process of preparing  these materials: IMHO, the statistical and machine learning is quite like the applied math:  modelling based on physics or domain knowledge with reasonale assumptions of mechanism -> develop computational techniques tools to solve by computers (so, numerical linear algebra and optimzation )  ->  assess the accuracy of models.  The last part is perhaps largely ignored in the applied math area because it is more related to specific domain knowledge; while this part is the core part of statistician: to evaluate the uncertainty of the model output and to improve the model. 

Overall, the coverage here is very classic. Senior undergraduates should be able to follow.
