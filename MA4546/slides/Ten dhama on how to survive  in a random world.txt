Ten dhama on how to survive  in a random world
by Xiang ZHOU


1. Do not be afraid of uncertainty:  the only certain thing is there is no certainty in the world.
2. In randomness, we know surety.
3. Any opportunity is hidden in noise. Every variance has a price.
4. Some noises come from ignorance but many others are not.
5. Do not scared that you are just ONE sample of the God--- you have a long life to play the dice.
6. You need many noisy failure to succeed in a transition.
7. Do not judge a person from his today's  sampling. try hard to estimate his distribution.
8. Any distribution is approximated by representative samples; any dream comes from a large number of doings.
9. Make good friends as many as possible because of LLN.
10. Only a large number and a long time can beat noise. So be patient.
