chapter 5 in ESL
and chapter 7 in ISL.




- spline = piecewise polynomial +  continuity at knots
- smoothing spline= spline + regularization of curvature = over-parametrization (knots=data x_i) + regularization 
- local regressoin = kernel 

All these are standared additve models with a very nice _linear function space_ well defined by the *basis* function 
Quite similar to the Finite Element Method minus Galerkin weak formulation.

These materials should be coverted in the  undergraduate level  numerical method course: the function approximation part
(together with Lagrangian interpolation, TV scheme, WNEO scheme)
 
If we go beyond further, we may consider two distinctive philisoply of constructing complex nonlinear high dimensional functions:

**basis function as nonlinear building block**  添砖加瓦
vs
**recursive function as activation function in neural network**  与时俱进
