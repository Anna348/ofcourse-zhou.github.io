[2]bias-variance :  decomposition of expected prediction square errors: bias+variance+irreudible error

This part essentially covers some core concepts in chaper 2 and 7 of ESL 2nd Edition.
Many concepts are particularly confusing and abstract for the beginners, 
but for a student in favor of rigorous math style,  these are important and the reading maybe enjoyable.
In fact, due to the terrible abuse of termilogies, the clear mathematical definitions are criticcally important.
